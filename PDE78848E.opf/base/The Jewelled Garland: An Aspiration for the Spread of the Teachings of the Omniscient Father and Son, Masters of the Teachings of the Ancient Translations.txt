This prayer, entitled The Jewelled Garland, for the spread of the precious teachings of the
great Omniscient One, Ngagi Wangpo, who epitomized the liberating lives of all the learned
and accomplished masters of India and Tibet, was composed at the request of the incarnation,
Drodül Namgyal Dorje Rinpoche, who is himself a noble holder of the supreme Omniscient
One’s teachings, and through the further encouragement of the chant leader, Jamyang Chöpel.
It was composed by the tantric master, who teaches every form of philosophy, Jampal Rolwe
Lodrö, also known as Khalong Yangpa Tsal, and the scribe was the novice-monk Tupten Dazang.
May virtue and positivity abound!
